                 <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Paint Protection Film Worth It?</strong></h2><p>This is the most common question car owners ask and for good reason. It’s a financial decision as much as it is a cosmetic one.</p><p>If you’ve ever paid for a respray or had to fix deep scratches on a modern clear coat, you already understand the cost.

It locks in the finish and keeps external threats at bay, which helps retain both aesthetic and resale value.</p><p>For collectors, that may mean fewer touch-ups. For commuters, it’s peace of mind in everyday parking lots.
